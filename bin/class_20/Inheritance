Inheritance:
it is the mechanism in Java through which we ca use the fields and methods from
one class to other class without rewriting/repeating the code from the class
from which we are inheriting.

BENEFITS:
-cleaner and more efficient code for memory and execution;
-it helps us reduce duplicate code;
-it saves time, cause we have to write less code;
-reusing the same code again

DISADVANTAGES:
-classes are coupled;
-if we make changes in one class they will happen in another;

e.g
Class Parent{

int Money;
void print(){
sout ("Money="+Mney)
}
}
class Child extends Parent{
main method(){
Child child=new Child();
child.print();

}

}

WE can access our static fields and methods using Class names and using objects
of the class but using class name is preferable because static method
belongs to class not the obj
