Yet another type of variables
1)Local
2)Instance variables
3)Class/static variables

LOCAL VARIABLES-
any variable that is declared inside a method or a block
like while/fore loops/ if condition or inside the constructor;

PROPERTIES OF LOCAL VARIABLES:
1)we cannot access them outside of the block;
e.g:
if(2>1){
int x=10 // this var will not be accessible outside of the {} of if condition
}
x=20 CE
2) as soon as we're done with the method these vars are destroyed and memory
 is freed and available to be used by other program, which means they're very efficient
 in managing the memory and that's why they are always recommended over instance var.



INSTANCE VARIABLES-
all of the var that are declared  outside of the methods
or block or constructors BUT INSIDE a class.

PROPERTIES of INSTANCE VAR:
1)memory is allocated inside RAM as soon as object of the class is created and
it stays in the memory unless we're done with the closing bracket;
2)they are highly discouraged because of the waste of the memory;

STATIC VARIABLES-
they are introduced to share the common data to all the instances.
They are declared outside of the methods, constructors and block of codes with static keyword;

===============================================================================================================


ACCESS MODIFIERS-
are just keywords(private, public, protected)
 that help us to reduce the visibility of our variables and methods so that no one else from other classes
 or packages can modify our data.

PRIVATE access modifier- if we use it with our var or method we can only access
 that var from the same class. We use it to protect critical info
  that we do not want to expose.

e.g:
Class bankAccount{
private int balance;
void depositMoney(){
if(boolean properChannel,int money){
balance=balance+money;
}
}
}

Class hacker{
balance=10000; //cannot access cause it's private
}


DEFAULT:
this is not a keyword, it's a behaviour which is assigned to the methods or properties
automatically if we're nor assigning any access modifier.

e.g
package1
Class{
String car;

}
package2
Class family{
car="I am your little brother, I'm usng your car today, forgive me if I destroy it";

}
If we don't specify any modifiers DEFAULT behaviour wll be assigned
to our variables and methods and they willonly be available within the same package.


PUBLIC:
if we declare out methods or instance variables we can access them from anywhere
any package and any class.

e.g
package1
Class{
public String car;

}
package2
Class family{
car ="I am your a random guy, I'm using your car today, forgive me if I destroy it";

}
