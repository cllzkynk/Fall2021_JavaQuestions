SUPER KEYWORD:
Super is a keyword in Java that we can use immediate parent class
members like fields,methods and constructors;

METHOD OVERLOADING:
-it's a way of utilizing methods with different parameters but same name;
-allows a class to have more than one method having the same name,
if their arguments are different.

In Java we can distinguish different methods by method signature;

METHOD SIGNATURE -is a combination of method name and  type of parameters that
we're passing as an argument and the sequence of the parameters.


We can create methods with same name if we the parameters to our methods have the below
properties:
1) method should have different number of parameters

print(){} //0parameters
print(String name){} /1
print(String name, String address){}//2
print(String name, String address, String phoneNumber){}//3

2)We can overload methods if we provide different types of parameters
print(){}
print(String name){}
print(int num1){}
print(double num1){}

3)We can also overload our methods if we change the sequence of the parameters;
print(String name, int num,char c){}
print(char c,int num,String name){}


NOTE:
by changing the return type or the access
modifiers we cannot overload methods in Java
