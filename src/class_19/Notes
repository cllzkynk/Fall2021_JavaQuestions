Recap:
Access modifiers:
Private
Protected
Default
Public

Access modifiers are used to control teh access to our class members
Like fields and methods

PRIVATE access modifier is the most restricted one.
It allows to access our class members like method and instance
var/fields/properties from the same class only.

Compiler -converts your java code to the byte come which our JWM can understand.
JVM takes byte code and converts to machine code that our computers can understand.


e.g
class PrivateClass{

private int salary

private transferSalaryToEmpBankAccount(){
//some code

}

}

Protected/Default
DEFAULT- is not a keyword, it's just a behaviour which is assigned to
our properties, methods if we don't specify any access modifier.
And these fields/properties/attributes or methods/ behaviours are then only
 accessible within the same package.

 PUBLIC access modifier:
 it is a keyword in Java and it controls the access to our fields and methods.
 If we use it all of our methods and fields can be accessed
 from anywhere inside our code base.
