CONSTRUCTORS:

1)It is a special block of code ,similar to a method that is
executed when we create an object of a class;
2)The purpose of constructors is to initialize our fields.
3)They must have the name same as  name of the class.
4)Constructors do not have return types not even void.
5)We can pass arguments to constructors just like we do for our methods.


SIMILARITIES BETWEEN CONSTRUCTOR AND METHODS
1)They both have parameters;
2)Both can have access modifiers like private, public and protected/default;


DIFFERENCES:
1)AS we can you any name for our method we cannot use any name for constructor ,
they must have the same name that class have.
2)Constructors cannot return values as methods can.
3)Constructors are automatically called when the instance of the class is created.
When should we use constructors?
When we want to control the initialization of the fields.

Instead of accessing the fields one by one we can use our constructor to initialize them.
